Tianji Cong is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan Computer Science & Engineering Division. He is affiliated with the Database Research Group advised by Professor H. V. Jagadish. He is interested in data management for structured and semi-structured data. His current work focuses on representation learning for tabular data discovery, semantics understanding, and integration.

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by professor [H. V. Jagadish](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jag/). My primary research interest is in data management for semi-structured data. My current work focuses on data discovery and data integration in data lakes. I previously worked with professor [Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/), investigating robustness and uncertainty of deep neural networks. -->
